# TripPlanner
A simple Java Swing application for travel route planning and visualization.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to search and mark locations on a map, so that I can plan my trip.
2. AS a user, I want to compare the options of the sites, so that I can choose the best.
3. As a user, I want to make a route for the trip, so that I can find the way.
4. As a user, I want to save and revisit my plans, so that I don't have to remember all the routes.

## Use Cases

- Compare different travel options between two points
- Generate the route connecting the points marked
